# Calculate Obstacle Distance
# ---------------------------
# Sound travels through the air at a speed of about 343 meters per second. From the following equation, one can determine the distance: (speed * time)/2
# This is because for every second recorded, the sound traveled 343 meters. Due to the fact that the sound travels from the sensor to the object and then
# bounces back, it needs to be divided by 2.
