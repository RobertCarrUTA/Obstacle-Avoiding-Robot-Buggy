## About the Project
Python was used to create this robotic Raspberry Pi project. Ultra sonic distance senors will allow the robot to avoid obstacles while driving forward.

## Compile Instructions
You need to know how GPIO pins work on the Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+, or 4 to run this program. I recommend looking up a GPIO reference card for your model.
* *Adding compile instructions later*

## Part List
*I would reccomend getting good quality parts, my wires ended up breaking and my motor controller board arrived broken. Upon order of the parts online from AliExpress, delivery was expected in 30-50 days.*
* Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+, or 4
* Motor controller board (Model I used - L298 Dual H-Bridge)
* Two 3V-6V DC motors
* Two wheels that fit the two motors
* Ball caster
* Ultrasonic distance sensor (UDS) (HC-SR04P (3.3V Tolerant) or HC-SR04 (5V))
  * If using a 5V UDS, you will need to split the voltage to output 3.3V using two resistors
* Jumper leads (I would take cable length into consideration, female-to-female and male-to-female)
* Battery holder (if you want it to move freely of a power cable)
* A small chasis for the buggy (I used cardboard)
